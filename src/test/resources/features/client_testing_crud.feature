  Scenario: Create a new client
    Given I have a client with the following details:
      |  Name  |  LastName  |  Country |  City   |        Email      |     Phone      |
      |  Luisa | Fuentes    | Colombia |  Bogot√° |  luisa@email.com  | 316-74-56-020  |
    When I send a POST request to create a client
    Then the response should have a status code of 201 for the client
    And the response should include the details of the created client
    And validates the response with client JSON schema for the client

    Then the response should have a status code of 200 for the client
    And validates the response with client list JSON schema for the clients
